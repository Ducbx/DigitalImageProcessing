# Digital Image Processing
This is the projects of course Digital Image Processing. Implementing traditional image processing methods based on CDib.h
## Env
- Cdib.h / Opencv3.4
- MFC GUI based on C++
- Visual studio 2017
##CDib
CDib is a device-irrelevant class, providing basic but necessary functions for digital image processing like image reading, writing, bit operations and etc.
## Theory
Here i implemented
1. Spatial domain operations 
   - In an image, space is a 2D plane (xy-plane). So, the spatial domain refers to the image plane itself and methods in spatial domain are based on directly modifying the value of the pixels, i.e. pixel2pixel translation.

2. Frequency domain
   - The frequency domain in image processing represents, at each point a particular frequency contained in the spatial domain of the image.Simplified, it is to study the change in pixel values in the image. These change in frequency is a characteristic of change in geometry of the image(spatial distribution). 
     - Edges reflects high frequency components,
     - Smooth regions have low frequency components.

3. Morphology method
   - Mathematical morphology (MM) is a theory and technique for the analysis and processing of geometrical structures, based on set theory, lattice theory, topology, and random functions.
