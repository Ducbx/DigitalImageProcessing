# Digital Image Processing
This is the projects of course, digital Image Processing. Implementing traditional image processing methods by C++/CDib.h
## Env
- MFC(C++) / Opencv3.4
- Visual studio 2017
- Cdib.h -- the basic layer of image processing
## Theory
Implementing the operations with 
1. Spatial domain W1-4/6-8/12
   - The term spatial refers to space. In an image, this space is a 2D plane (xy-plane). So, the spatial domain refers to the image plane itself and methods in spatial domain are based on directly modifying the value of the pixels.
2. Frequency domain W5/9/10
   - The frequency domain in image processing represents, at each point a particular frequency contained in the spatial domain of the image.Simplified, it is to study the change in pixel values in the image. These change in frequency is a characteristic of change in geometry of the image(spatial distribution). 
     - Edges reflects high frequency components,
     - Smooth regions have low frequency components.
3. morphology method W13-15
   - Mathematical morphology (MM) is a theory and technique for the analysis and processing of geometrical structures, based on set theory, lattice theory, topology, and random functions.
